# Authoritative Movement Implementation - Test Guide

This document describes how to test the newly implemented server-authoritative movement system (Item 22).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Prediction (`ClientMovementSystem`)
- **Location**: `Client/Networking/ClientMovementSystem.cs`
- **Purpose**: Handles client-side movement prediction and server reconciliation
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintains both predicted and server-authoritative positions
  - Sends input messages to server with sequence numbers
  - Reconciles client prediction with server updates
  - Provides smooth interpolated display position

### 2. Server-Side Authority (`ServerMovementSystem`)
- **Location**: `Server/Game/ServerMovementSystem.cs`
- **Purpose**: Processes player inputs and maintains authoritative game state
- **Key Features**:
  - Validates and processes player input messages
  - Maintains authoritative player positions
  - Basic anti-cheat movement validation
  - Broadcasts game state updates to all clients

### 3. Network Protocol (`NetworkMessage.cs`)
- **Location**: `Shared/Networking/NetworkMessage.cs`
- **Purpose**: Defines message types for client-server communication
- **Message Types**:
  - `PlayerInputMessage`: Client sends input to server
  - `PlayerPositionMessage`: Server sends position update to client
  - `GameStateUpdateMessage`: Server broadcasts full game state

## How It Works

### Client Input Flow:
1. Player presses movement keys (WASD)
2. `PlayerController.UpdateWithNetworking()` captures input
3. `ClientMovementSystem.ProcessInput()` creates a `PlayerInputMessage`
4. Client predicts movement locally for responsiveness
5. Input message sent to server via UDP

### Server Processing:
1. `GameSessionManager.HandleNetworkMessage()` receives input
2. `ServerMovementSystem.ProcessPlayerInput()` validates and applies movement
3. Server maintains authoritative position
4. `PlayerPositionMessage` sent back to client with processed input sequence

### Client Reconciliation:
1. Client receives `PlayerPositionMessage` from server
2. `ClientMovementSystem.ReceiveServerUpdate()` processes server state
3. Client removes acknowledged inputs from prediction queue
4. Re-applies unacknowledged inputs on top of server position
5. Display position interpolated between server and predicted positions

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites:
1. Build all projects: `dotnet build`
2. Run the server: `dotnet run --project Server`
3. Run the client: `dotnet run --project Client`

### Test Scenarios:

#### 1. Basic Movement Test
- **Goal**: Verify client-server movement synchronization
- **Steps**:
  1. Start server locally
  2. Connect client to server
  3. Move character with WASD keys
  4. Observe smooth movement with server validation

#### 2. Network Lag Simulation
- **Goal**: Test prediction and reconciliation under latency
- **Steps**:
  1. Add artificial delay in `ServerAllocationManager.SendMessageAsync()`
  2. Move character rapidly
  3. Verify prediction keeps movement smooth
  4. Confirm reconciliation when server updates arrive

#### 3. Anti-Cheat Validation
- **Goal**: Verify server rejects suspicious movement
- **Steps**:
  1. Modify client to send impossible movement speeds
  2. Check server logs for "Suspicious movement" warnings
  3. Confirm server doesn't update position for invalid moves

## Key Benefits

1. **Responsiveness**: Client prediction provides immediate feedback
2. **Authority**: Server has final say on all positions
3. **Consistency**: All clients see the same authoritative state
4. **Anti-Cheat**: Server validates movement bounds and speeds
5. **Smooth Gameplay**: Interpolation hides network latency

## Next Steps (Item 23)

The movement system is now ready for implementing authoritative spell casting:
- Spells will use similar client prediction + server validation
- Server will maintain spell cooldowns and resource costs
- Damage and effects will be server-authoritative
- Clients will receive spell effect notifications

## Architecture Notes

- **Separation of Concerns**: Movement logic isolated from rendering
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new message types for spells/combat
- **Performance**: Efficient UDP-based networking
- **Maintainable**: Clear interfaces between client/server systems
